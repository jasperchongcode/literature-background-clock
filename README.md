# literature-background-clock
Tell the time through stylised book quotes on your desktop background (built for mac)

- quote_converter.ipynb is for generating the background images (edit this to match your personal preferences/screen size)
- image_input.jpg is the image used to overlay quotes (make sure it matches the resolution of the generated images)
- run.py for running the program, due to limitations with applescript you need to run it will non-fullscreen, and after pressing play you can minimise it.
